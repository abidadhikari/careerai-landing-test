          In the past, crafting a compelling resume was often a time-consuming
          and overwhelming endeavor. Job seekers had to sift through numerous
          templates and carefully select and format information, all while
          hoping their efforts would capture the attention of hiring managers.
          According to a survey by TopResume, an online resume-writing service,
          75% of recruiters spend only six seconds reviewing a resume. That
          means you have a brief window of opportunity to make a lasting
          impression. However, thanks to the advent of AI-based resume builders
          like CareerAI, the entire resume-building process has undergone a
          remarkable transformation, becoming more efficient, accurate, and
          impactful. By leveraging the features and capabilities of CareerAI and

        <h3>Understanding the Role of AI in Resume Building</h3>
        <p>
          The emergence of AI-based resume builders has brought about a profound
          revolution in the way resumes are created. These tools empower job
          seekers to navigate resume-building with increased efficiency,
          personalization, and optimization. By leveraging AI, job seekers can
          now create resumes that not only effectively capture the attention of
          hiring managers but also enhance their chances of securing their
          desired roles. The impact of AI-based resume builders cannot be
          understated as they continue redefining and elevating modern resume
          creation standards. However, let&apos;s take a closer look at the
          roles.

            <a href="https://www.topresume.com/">TopResume</a>, 78% of job
            seekers spend more than an hour on their resumes, while 47% spend
            two or more hours. AI-based tools automate this process by
            extracting relevant details from profiles, analyzing job
            descriptions, and generating personalized recommendations,
            streamlining the process and saving time.
