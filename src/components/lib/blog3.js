        <h2>What is an ATS-friendly resume?</h2>
        <p>
          An ATS-friendly resume is a type of resume that is designed to work
          well with computer systems used by companies to manage job
          applications. These systems, known as Applicant Tracking Systems
          (ATS), help employers handle a large number of resumes efficiently. An
          ATS-friendly resume is easy for the computer system to read and
          understand, increasing the chances of your resume being seen by a
          human recruiter. These resumes use simple fonts, basic formatting, and
          standard headings. Additionally, it also includes relevant keywords
          from the job description and avoids using complex graphics or symbols.
        </p>

        <p>
          In simpler terms, an ATS-friendly resume is a special kind of resume
          that computers can read easily. Companies use computer programs to
          manage many job applications, which helps those programs work better.
          When you make your resume ATS-friendly, it&apos;s more likely to reach
          a human recruiter who might consider you for the job. However, to
          understand how these guidelines can help boost your employability,
          let&apos;s delve deeper into the benefits and advantages of an
          ATS-friendly resume.
        </p>

        <h2>Importance and Benefits of ATS-Friendly Resumes</h2>
        <p>
          Although ATS has undeniably improved the efficiency of the recruitment
          process, it has also posed a challenge for job seekers. If your resume
          isn&apos;t ATS-friendly, you run the risk of being disregarded, no
          matter how qualified or experienced you are. According to an article
          by&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ats-friendly-resumes-why-professional-resume-writing-can-vairavel/">
            LinkedIn,&nbsp;
          </a>
          almost 75% of resumes get rejected by ATS even before a human
          recruiter sees them, highlighting the crucial importance of having a
          resume that can successfully navigate through automated screening.
          Besides this, here are some key reasons why having an ATS-friendly
          resume is crucial:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Automated Screening:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many companies now utilize the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to
          handle the large volume of resumes they receive. ATS software
          automatically scans and filters resumes based on specific keywords,
          formatting, and other criteria set by the employer. If your resume is
          not ATS-friendly, it may never even reach the hands of a human
          recruiter.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Increased Visibility:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An ATS-friendly resume increases your chances of being seen by
          recruiters and hiring managers. By optimizing your resume for ATS, you
          ensure that it aligns with the system&apos;s requirements, making it
          more likely to pass through the initial screening and land in the
          hands of a hiring manager.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Time and Cost Efficiency:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An ATS streamlines recruitment, allowing employers to quickly sift
          through numerous applications. If your resume is ATS-friendly, it
          saves recruiters time and effort in reviewing your qualifications,
          which can be a significant advantage in a competitive job market.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reflects Adaptability:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An ATS-friendly resume demonstrates your adaptability to modern hiring
          practices and technology. Employers appreciate candidates who can
          embrace new tools and trends, as it reflects their ability to stay
          current in their respective fields.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Tailored for Keywords:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ATS software identifies relevant keywords and phrases related to the
          job posting. An ATS-friendly resume ensures that you have incorporated
          these keywords strategically, improving your chances of matching the
          job requirements and ranking higher in the ATS results.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Fair Evaluation:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An ATS offers a standardized and impartial evaluation process,
          focusing on qualifications and skills rather than personal
          characteristics. An ATS-friendly resume ensures a fair assessment of
          all candidates based on their suitability for the role.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Customizable for Each Application:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Making your resume ATS-friendly doesn&apos;t mean sacrificing its
          quality or uniqueness. You can still customize your resume for each
          job application while ensuring it remains compatible with ATS
          requirements.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>A Positive First Impression:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your resume is often the first point of contact with potential
          employers. An ATS-friendly resume that is well-structured, easy to
          read, and properly formatted enhances your chances of making a
          positive first impression.
        </p>
